# condicionamento-web
## Web page made for simplifying a psychology experiment in conditiniong with phrases


The experiment consists in letting the subject form phrases and giving a positive/negative feedback based on what you aim to condition. The first page consists in a formulary to collect personal information about the subject, redirecting to a second page that is where the subject will form phrases.


For better data collection all phrases formed are stored in a data.txt file for each subject.
